### Motivation
Nowadays, as technological advancements revolutionize industries, digital car trading platforms have emerged as vital marketplaces, transforming the automotive market and the way people buy and sell second-hand vehicles. Notably, CarDekho.com is a well-known car trading platform based in India. The primary motivation for this analysis stems from the growing importance of platforms like CarDekho.com in connecting buyers and sellers. In particular, for buyers, understanding the relationship between car traits and pricing can facilitate purchasing decisions, and help assess whether a car is priced fairly. Meanwhile, for sellers, the insights into pricing trends can help attract more potential customers while still setting competitive selling prices, determining the optimal price for their listings. Thus, this study aims to investigate a deeper understanding of these relationships by addressing the following research questions:
-	What are the relationships between the selling price and continuous covariates (year, km_driven)?
-	What categorical variables are associated with the selling price, and how do these variables influence pricing?
-	What regression model can effectively explain and interpret the relationships in the data?
By answering these questions, we aim to develop a statistical model that contributes to the car trading marked by offering data-driven insights.
